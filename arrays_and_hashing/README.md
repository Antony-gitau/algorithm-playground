This repository contains solutions to the blind 75 problems on [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io) site. 

My intention is to solve these problems as outlined on [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MnkzzanUtLieQAnUXSDaHtDcdTwhM9GUqLqK7eUta-o/edit#gid=0) a copy from Neetcode.io. 

I intend to describe the strategy explained by Neetcode as well as my strategy or other strategies that come to my mind. 
I will focus on using python in most implementation. However, I might use C/C++ at times.

Apart from having a readme section for every solution, I will heavily comment the code to ensure that every line is understood to even a beginner.
